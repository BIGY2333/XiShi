## synopsis ##
In this lab,we should ues development tools and to design algorithms in mutable and immutable styles,analyze different approaches algorithms and data structures design.Besides,develop unit and property-based tests.The selected data structure should be implemented in two way: as a mutable object (interaction with an object can modify it); as an immutable object (interaction with an object cannot change it).For each version of a library (mutable and immutable),we should implement ten feature.
